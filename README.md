A Flappy Bird clone that I made as a university house coding challenge. It was made in under 4 hours including the art, the music was a random playlist I had sitting on my computer.

This game is the 8th iteration of my flappy bird clones. I never posted them anywhere as they were not intended to be games rather they were made to test my skills throughout high school and finally at the end of my first year of University, I can lay this projct to bed as it has done everything and more that I had intended for it.

Note: This repository is unmaintained and may take a bit of work to get it working again.
